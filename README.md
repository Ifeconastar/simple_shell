#Alx  School - Simple Shell Project

A project to code a simple shell for Holberton School. The project is to replicate the basic functionality of a Linux shell to test our knowledge of the C programming language. There were restrictions placed on which C standard library functions we were allowed to use. So, many  functions were recreated for use inside the code.

###How to Install
Compile the code like so:
```
gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```
This will cause all warnings to act as compilation errors and will name the executable file hsh.

##Usage
Run like so:
```
./hsh
```
The shell can accept commands, which should be given like so:
```
$ command [args ...]
```
