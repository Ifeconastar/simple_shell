.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hosh
is a command interpretor created as a project for Holberton School. Under set guidelines it aims to create a new shell with much of the basic functionality of the standard Linux shell most systems use. It can run basic commands from the PATH or use their full path filenames. As well as run some builtin functions.
.SH Builtins
.IP exit
Exit current process and free up memory
.IP env
Print out all environment variables and their, one line per variable
.IP setenv
Change the value of an environment variable, if no environment variable exits create one
.IP unsetenv

.IP help
Displays all builtins if no argument given, otherwise displays brief description if builtin names are passed as arguments.
.SH Exit Status
Any failure from inside the shell will cause the shell to exit with a nonzero status. If the shell runs and exits successfully it's exit status will be 0.
.SH BUGS
Not every possible input has been tested, so some inputs may cause unexpected results. Currently this program does not successfully free all memory that it allocates during runtime.
